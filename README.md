## Drills

1. Get all items that contain text. A function that takes one parameter for `searchTerm` which will be any string. The function will query the `shopping_list` table using Knex methods and select the rows which have a `name` that contains the `searchTerm` using a case insensitive match.

2. Get all items paginated. A function that takes one parameter for `pageNumber` which will be a number. The function will query the `shopping_list` table using Knex methods and select the `pageNumber` page of rows paginated to 6 items per page.

3. Get all items added after date. A function that takes one paramet for `daysAgo` which will be a number representing a number of days. This function will query the `shopping_list` table using Knex methods and select the rows which have a `date_added` that is greater than the `daysAgo`.

4. Get the total cost for each category. A function that takes no parameters. The function will query the `shopping_list` table using Knex methods and select the rows grouped by their category and showing the total price for each category.
